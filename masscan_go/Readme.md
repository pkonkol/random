This is still WIP
Masscan_go is a program supposed to run masscan on autonomous systems deemed
interesting and then perform more accurate scans on hosts deemed interesting.
Results will be stored in a DB while ASes will be put on an interactive map
based on location retrieved from whois/organistaion/address fields.
